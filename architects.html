          <p class="lead">Frank Gehry is considered one of the most influential architects of the late 20th century. He completed his architecture studies at the University of Southern California in 1954, and enrolled at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design to study urban planning, but dropped out soon after and returned to Los Angeles. There he worked at Gruen Associates until 1962, when he established his own firm. During the early period of his independent practice he developed close associations with the artists of the Venice and Santa Monica art scene, particularly Edward Kienholz, Robert Irwin, and Ed Ruscha.</p>

          <p class="lead">Hadid created architecture that didn’t look like what architecture was expected to look like. Her designs embraced angular forms and swooping lines straight out of Modernist paintings. These were quite different from the rectangular forms so central to architectural design. She argued for these new forms—and a rejection of how architecture had been designed in the recent past—through a short discussion of randomness and arbitrariness published in 1982. She saw her own work as containing randomness, which holds both logic and forethought. Those are characteristics not found in arbitrariness. </p>

          <p class="lead">In Denmark, Ingels became well known after designing two housing complexes: VM Houses and Mountain Dwellings. In 2006 he founded Bjarke Ingels Group, which grew to a staff of 400 by 2015, with noted projects including the 8 House housing complex, VIA 57 West in Manhattan, the Google North Bayshore headquarters (co-designed with Thomas Heatherwick), the Superkilen park, and the Amager Resource Center (ARC). In 2011, The Wall Street Journal named Ingels Innovator of the Year for architecture, and in 2016 Time named him one of the 100 Most Influential People.</p>

          <p class="lead">Internationally influential Swiss architect and city planner, whose designs combine the functionalism of the modern movement with a bold sculptural expressionism. He belonged to the first generation of the so-called International school of architecture and was their most able propagandist in his numerous writings. In his architecture he joined the functionalist aspirations of his generation with a strong sense of expressionism. He was the first architect to make a studied use of rough-cast concrete, a technique that satisfied his taste for asceticism and for sculptural forms. In 2016, 17 of his architectural works were named World Heritage sites by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization).</p>

Closely associated with the development of high-tech architecture, Foster is recognised as a key figure in British modernist architecture. His architectural practice Foster + Partners, first founded in 1967 as Foster Associates, is the largest in the United Kingdom, and maintains offices internationally. He is the president of the Norman Foster Foundation, created to 'promote interdisciplinary thinking and research to help new generations of architects, designers and urbanists to anticipate the future'. Foster was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 1999.</p>

          <p class="lead">Richard Meier is an American architect. He was born in Newark, in the state of New Jersey. He studied architecture at Cornell University and then worked in several architectural firms, including Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and Marcel Breuer, until he opened his own firm in 1963. From the beginning, Meier has followed a determined and permanent line in his projects. He has put aside passing trends and fads, and has remained faithful to his ideas. Although his most recent buildings show a refinement compared to his initial ones, they continue to have the same unmistakable style, in which Meier always gives the same importance to clarity of lines, harmony, spaces and light.</p>
